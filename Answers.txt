Q1).    what is the difference between Internal Storage & External Storage?
Ans:    Internal Storage is a type of storage that is in built in to the phone 
        and non volatile in nature. It is  not acesible by the user except via
        installed applications (or by gaining root acess to the phone)
        Example: data/data/app_packageName
    
        External Storage is any form of storage that can be added to the the
        internal storage. It is generally removable in  nature
        Example: Micro SDCard

Q2).    For how long does data reside in the Cache?
Ans:    Typically data will continue to remain in the cache until there is no
        longer any more room for it. Alternatively there could be scheduling
        algorithms that devise what data would stay in the cache for what period
        of time 
        Example: First-In First Out (FIFO), Last-in First(LIFO)



    
Q3).    What are the critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? What are the
        examples of each?
Ans:    
        Normal permissions cover areas where your application needs to acess
        data or resources outside the application's sandbox but where there is
        very little risk to the user's privacy or the operation of other
        applications. Example permission to set the time zone is a normal
        permission.If an app declares that it needs a normal permission the
        system automatically grants the permission to the application.

        Critical Permissions cover areas that the application wnats dat or
        resources that involove the user's private infromation or could
        potentially affect the user's stored data or the operation of any other
        application. For example the ability to read the user's contact is an
        dangeraous permission. If an app declares the it needs a dangerous
        permission he user has to explicitly grant the permission to the app.
